## Stakeholders
- Director of Marketing
- Cyclistic marketing analytics team

## Data Source
Public Cyclistic historical bike trip data provided by Motivate International Inc. The data includes ride-level information such as trip duration, start/end times, and rider type (member vs casual).

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicate and incomplete records
- Created a ride_length variable
- Removed rides with negative or zero duration
- Created a day_of_week variable
- Standardized column names and membership labels
- Combined multiple datasets into a single dataset

## Analysis Summary
Casual riders tend to take longer rides and primarily use bikes on weekends, suggesting leisure usage. Annual members ride more frequently on weekdays, indicating commuting behavior.

## Key Findings
- Casual riders take longer rides on average
- Members ride more frequently
- Casual usage peaks on weekends and during warmer months

## Recommendations
1. Target weekend riders with limited-time membership offers  
2. Promote cost savings for frequent riders  
3. Use digital marketing to convert repeat casual users

## Conclusion
Casual riders already show strong engagement with Cyclistic. Targeted marketing strategies can convert these riders into annual members and increase long-term profitability.
